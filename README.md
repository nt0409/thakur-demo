### 1. Wavefunction

*   **Definition:** The ***wavefunction***, denoted by Ψ(r, t), is a mathematical function that describes the ***quantum state*** of a particle or system. It contains all the information about the particle's properties.
*   **Interpretation:** The square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, |Ψ(r, t)|², gives the ***probability density*** of finding the particle at position *r* at time *t*.
*   **Normalization:** The integral of |Ψ(r, t)|² over all space must equal 1, representing the certainty that the particle exists somewhere. ∫ |Ψ(r, t)|² d³r = 1
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   The wavefunction is generally complex-valued.
    *   It evolves in time according to the ***Schrödinger equation***.
    *   Different wavefunctions can represent different states of the same particle.

---

### 2. Schrödinger Equation

*   **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation:**
    *   iħ ∂Ψ(r, t)/∂t = HΨ(r, t)
    *   Where:
        *   i is the imaginary unit
        *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant

*   **Properties:**
    *   Eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real.

---

### 5. Wave-packets

*   **Definition:** A ***wave-packet*** is a superposition of waves with different wavelengths (or momenta) that interfere constructively in a localized region of space.
*   **Construction:** Wave-packets are created by summing (or integrating) over a range of wave numbers (k)
    *   Ψ(x, t) = ∫ A(k) e^(i(kx - ωt)) dk
    *   Where A(k) is the amplitude of the wave with wave number k, and ω is the angular frequency.
*   **Group Velocity:** The velocity at which the wave-packet's envelope propagates.
    *   vg = dω/dk

### 6. Time Evolution

*   **Governed by the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation:** As mentioned before, iħ ∂Ψ(r, t)/∂t = HΨ(r, t) dictates the change of a quantum state over time.
*   **Evolution Operator:**  The formal solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation can be written as
    *   Ψ(t) = U(t, t₀)Ψ(t₀)

*   **Equations:**
    *   d⟨x⟩/dt = ⟨p⟩/m
    *   d⟨p⟩/dt = -⟨dV(x)/dx⟩
    *   Where:
        *   ⟨x⟩ is the expectation value of position
        *   ⟨p⟩ is the expectation value of momentum
        *   m is the mass of the particle
        *   V(x) is the potential energy
*   **Significance:** It provides a connection between quantum and classical mechanics, showing that classical behavior emerges as an average over quantum states.

---

### 8. Uncertainty Principle

*   **Statement:** The ***uncertainty principle*** states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical quantities can be known simultaneously.
*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:**
    *   Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2
    *   Where:
        *   Δx is the uncertainty in position
        *   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum
*   **Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle:**
    *   ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2
    *   Where:

**Short Answer Questions:**

4.  State Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and explain its physical significance.

    **Answer:** Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is greater than or equal to ħ/2: ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2. Physically, it means that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely we can simultaneously know the position and momentum of a particle. The more accurately we know one, the less accurately we can know the other.
5.  Explain the concept of quantum tunneling and provide a real-world application.

    **Answer:** Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon where a particle can pass through a potential barrier even if its energy is less than the barrier height. This is a purely quantum mechanical effect that has no classical analog. A real-world application is the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM), which uses tunneling current to image surfaces at the atomic level.

**Essay/Long-Form Question:**

6.  Discuss the importance of the Hydrogen atom in the development of quantum mechanics. Explain how solving the Schrödinger equation for the Hydrogen atom provides insights into atomic structure and spectroscopy.

    **Answer:** The hydrogen atom played a pivotal role in the development of quantum mechanics because it was the first real physical system to which the Schrödinger equation was successfully applied. The analytical solution of the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom provided a precise understanding of its energy levels and wavefunctions. These results were in excellent agreement with experimental observations of the hydrogen spectrum, validating the quantum mechanical approach.

    Specifically, the solution revealed that the energy levels are quantized, meaning that only certain discrete energy values are allowed. These energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number (n), and the transitions between these levels explain the observed spectral lines. The solution also introduced the concept of atomic orbitals, which are the spatial distributions of the electron in the atom.

    Furthermore, the solution of the hydrogen atom problem led to the introduction of other important quantum numbers, such as the angular momentum quantum number (l) and the magnetic quantum number (m), which describe the shape and orientation of the atomic orbitals. These quantum numbers are essential for understanding the electronic structure of more complex atoms and molecules.

    In summary, the successful solution of the hydrogen atom problem provided strong evidence for the validity of quantum mechanics and laid the foundation for understanding the structure and properties of all atoms and molecules. It also introduced key concepts such as energy quantization, atomic orbitals, and quantum numbers, which are fundamental to modern chemistry and physics.
